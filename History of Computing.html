        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Computing has been used throughout time as far back as 3000 BC with the tool of the
        Abacus and continues to be utilized throughout everyday life. Popular inventions, including the previously
        mentioned Abacus, involve Alan Turing’s ENIGMA, Konrad Zuse’s Z3, and John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert’s
        ENIAC and have contributed to today’s achievements in computers.

    <h3 style="background: #e3960c"> The Abacus </h3>
    <p> <table style="width: 50%"> <td colspan="5">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first calculating device invented and used was most likely the abacus of 500 B.C.
        Ancient civilizations have been known to use pebbles and sand to make their very own quick-abacus or calculator.
        In later days, wires were then used to suspend pebbles and was made portable. The Abacus was used to count
        numbers larger than the human hand can count, add, subtract, multiply and divide quantities. Greek, Roman,
        Chinese, and more cultures have used this tool and are share similar techniques of reading the abacus.

    <h3 style="background: #fcff00"> The Z3 Computer </h3>
    <p> <table style="width: 52%"> <td colspan="5">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Computing devices and machines were numerous during 20th century and one of the earliest
        inventions was the Z3 computer created by Konrad Zuse. Whilst maintaining a few mechanical engineering problems,
        the Z3 computer included most of the necessities that computers of today involve and was the very first computer
        to run a program on it. Unlike the Z1 or Z2, the Z3 computer stored its program into an external tape. The
        original Z3 computer creation was destroyed during the World War II bombings and only a replica stands today.

    <h3 style="background: #0add00"> ENIGMA </h3>
    <p> <table style="width: 50%"> <td colspan="5">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another invention created in the earlier 20th century that has recently been given more
        spotlight through the 2015 motion picture “The Imitation Game” is Alan Turing’s ENIGMA that was invented in
        1942.The ENIGMA was intended to be used to translate German code using rotors when any key is pressed.
        Decrypting German codes through the electromechanical ENIGMA worked the input, process, and output process and
        therefore can be considered a computing tool. Turing’s invention the ENIGMA allowed the Allies to save countless
        lives and was a major success in getting an upper-hand on the enemy. The ENIGMA has been duplicated, re-sized
        and improved throughout the years and is continues to decode messages.

    <h3 style="background: blue"> <font color="white">&nbsp;The Odyssey </font></h3>
    <p> <table style="width: 52%"> <td colspan="5">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A popular use of computing in our society today is through gaming consoles such as the
        XBox and Playstation franchises. In the beginning of the video game age, Magnavox released it’s Magnavox Odyssey
        months before the well known video game, Pong. The Odyssey displayed low resolution and simple pictures that the
        player would interact with and uniquely involved physical items with the Odyssey such as dice, money, deck of
        cards, and poker chips. The inspiration of the Odyssey came from the “Brown Box” that also allowed users to play
        simple games by flipping switches on the physical box. The Odyssey was not considered a commercial success due
        to Pong’s outbreak also in 1972. The release of Pong was the start of a new interest and revolution of video
        game making and has continued to inspire more and more consoles and arcade games today.

    <p> <table style="width: 50%"> <td colspan="5">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final analysis, computing has been used throughout history, even before the
        creation of a computer itself. The early inventions that inspired the computing devices we have today were
        machines that would fulfill a task for war, entertainment, or even to be efficient. The 21st century now
        consists of multiple efficient computing devices and popular, successful companies like Microsoft and Apple.
        However, the products that we produce and utilize this day would have never achieved such fame and importance
        if not for the creators of the past.
